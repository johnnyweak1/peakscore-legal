# Terms & Conditions
**Effective Date:** 2025-12-09

These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the **Peak Score** mobile application (hereafter referred to as the "Application") developed by **Jan Słaby** (hereafter referred to as the "Service Provider"), and provided as a **Freemium** service with optional paid subscriptions and one-time purchases.

By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using the Application. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Application.


## 1. Intellectual Property and Usage Restrictions
The Application, including its source code, content, trademarks, and all related intellectual property rights, is the exclusive property of the Service Provider.

You are **not permitted to**:
* Copy, modify, or distribute the Application or any part of it
* Decompile, reverse engineer, or extract the source code
* Translate or create derivative works based on the Application
* Use our trademarks or content without explicit permission

## 2. Pricing, Subscriptions, Free Trials and Charges

The Application is offered as a free service with optional paid features available through auto-renewing subscriptions and one-time purchases processed by the App Store and/or RevenueCat.

### 2.1 Weekly Subscription and Free Trial
The Application may offer a weekly subscription plan with a free trial period (for example, a 3-day free trial). The exact prices, currencies and trial duration are determined by the App Store and shown to you before you confirm your purchase.

If you start a free trial, you will not be charged until the trial period ends. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid weekly subscription and you will be charged the applicable weekly price.

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period and will continue until you cancel them in your App Store account settings. You are responsible for managing and cancelling your subscription through your App Store account. We do not process payments directly and are not able to cancel subscriptions on your behalf.

### 2.2 Lifetime Access (One-Time Purchase)
The Application may offer a one-time purchase that grants "lifetime access" to certain features.

For the purposes of these Terms, **"lifetime access" means access for the lifetime of the Application**, understood as the period during which the Service Provider chooses, at its sole discretion, to continue offering and supporting the Application as a consumer product.

"Lifetime access":
* does **not** mean the lifetime of you as an individual or any particular device or operating system,
* does **not** guarantee that the Application or any specific feature will remain available or unchanged forever,
* does **not** guarantee compatibility with all future devices, operating systems, or platform policies.

The Service Provider may, at any time and for any reason, discontinue the Application, remove or modify features, or cease to support specific platforms or devices. In such cases, your lifetime access will also end, and, except where required by applicable law or App Store policies, you will not be entitled to any refund or other compensation.

### 2.3 Changes to Pricing and Paid Offerings
We reserve the right to change the pricing, structure or availability of subscriptions, lifetime access, and other paid offerings at any time, including introducing new plans or discontinuing existing ones. Any such changes will not affect charges that have already been incurred and will be communicated to you through the Application or the App Store where required.

The Service Provider aims to keep the Application useful and efficient. However, we reserve the right to:
* Modify or discontinue any feature of the Application
* Introduce fees for certain features or services

Any such changes or charges will be clearly communicated to you in advance where required by applicable law or platform policies.


## 3. Data Collection and Processing
The Application may collect and process **personal data** in accordance with our Privacy Policy. This includes account data (e.g., email, first name, optional birth date and gender), usage statistics, and device technical data. It also includes profile and preference data you choose to provide to enable core features, such as target sleep hours, strain mode, recovery energy goal option, max heart rate settings (formula and custom BPM), heart rate zone cut-offs, measurement units (energy, weight, distance), manual energy targets, selected data source and selected goal, legal acceptance and onboarding status, and related timestamps and schema metadata.
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any fitness configuration values you provide; the Application uses these values to compute metrics and personalize your experience.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application.

**⚠️ Important:**

We strongly advise **against jailbreaking or rooting** your device. Doing so may compromise its security and affect the functionality of the Application.


## 4. Third-Party Services
The Application integrates with third-party services that have their own terms and privacy policies. By using the Application, you also agree to the terms of these services:
* Google Analytics for Firebase
* Firebase Crashlytics
* Firebase Cloud Firestore (data storage/hosting)
* RevenueCat

We are not responsible for issues or data handling practices related to these services.


## 5. Internet Access and Network Responsibility
Some features of the Application require an active internet connection. This can be via Wi-Fi or mobile data.

The Service Provider is **not responsible** if:
* You are unable to access the Application due to lack of internet
* Your data allowance is exceeded
* You incur charges from your mobile provider (e.g., for roaming or excess data usage)

If you use the Application on a device not owned by you, you confirm that you have the bill payer's permission.


## 6. User Responsibilities
You are solely responsible for:
* Ensuring your device is sufficiently charged to use the Application
* Keeping your login information (if applicable) secure
* Using the Application in accordance with local laws

The Service Provider is not liable for any inconvenience, loss, or damage resulting from failure to meet the above responsibilities.


## 7. Limitation of Liability
The Application is provided **"AS IS"**. While we strive to keep it updated and accurate, we rely on third-party data sources and cannot guarantee its completeness or accuracy.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Provider disclaims any liability for:
* Errors or omissions in the content
* Direct or indirect damages caused by the use or inability to use the Application
* Interruptions, bugs, or data loss


## 8. Updates and Termination
We may update the Application to enhance functionality or comply with technical requirements. You agree to install all available updates.

We may also discontinue the Application or revoke your access at any time without prior notice. Upon termination:
* Your right to use the Application ends immediately
* You must uninstall and delete the Application from your device
If you have an active subscription or have purchased lifetime access, you acknowledge that your access to paid features is also subject to this section. If the Application is discontinued, significantly modified, or becomes unavailable (for example, due to changes in platform policies, technical limitations, or business reasons), your subscription and/or lifetime access may end. Except where required by applicable law or App Store policies, you are not entitled to any refund or compensation as a result of such discontinuation or modification.


## 9. Changes to These Terms
These Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.

We recommend reviewing this page periodically. Continued use of the Application following updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
